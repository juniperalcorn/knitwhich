# KnitWhich
A Knitting Utilities and Ravelry Extension App
Take a look at [KnitWhich] (#).

## Project Description
KnitWhich is a knitting utilities app, which accesses the [Ravelry](https://ravelry.com) API. Ravelry is the world's largest site for knitting, including enormous pattern databases, social networking, business pages, and individual project management tools. 

Rather than attempt to mimic Ravelry's incredible functionality, KnitWhich compliments it and gives users a seamless on-the-go access to their personal Ravelry data, and some additional mobile tools.

From the Ravelry API, KnitWhich lists a user's Ravelry library, and lists the patterns in the "My Patterns" component. Under "Tools," Knitwhich lists a user's knitting needles, previously logged to the Ravelry website.

In addition, KnitWhich offers two utilities: an accurate 10cm x 10cm ruler (accurate on mobile, tablet, and computer screens). This helps knitters to keep track of their progress or create their own ruler on the fly. There is also a Row Counters component, where users can add and label row counters for different projects, eliminating the need for easily misplaced notions.

### Wireframes

### MVP and PostMVP
#### MVP 
MVP for KnitWhich is accessing the Ravelry API to list the user's current library and needle stash, and providing functional tools for the modern knitter.
#### PostMVP
KnitWhich has incredible potential to expand, offering a seamless mobile experience of Ravelry's expansive services. Top PostMVP goals for KnitWhich include expanded API access to allow any user to access their Ravelry user data. This will entail a log-in and back-end development. Additionally, users will be able to update their Needle Library through a link to an Add Needle component: using forms and an API Post, users can set and send data for a new set of needles. Finally, users will be able to download actual patterns from their Ravelry library (those that they have access to), and view them through the KnitWhich app without needing to log into the Ravelry website through a browser, or use other document viewing apps.

### User Stores

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
